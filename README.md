## Academic Project Aims
---

I am currently pursuing my **Diploma in Web App Development** from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ "code Institute").

The academic aim of this project is to demonstrate my newly developed skills within Javascript by building an interactive front-end site.
It will be responsive to users actions, allowing them to engage with the presented data, elements and imagery to progress through an engaging "text-adventure" game.

The user will be able to interact with the games many elements in order to reach the satisfying conclusion of passing the "H.U.G. Protocol."

As the site owner I will achieve my goal of providing an engaging and fast to digest "Text-Adventure" game for multiple users to enjoy.

I intend to display the above throughout the project via my: coding, comments, commits, and the explanation provided by this README file.

Additional functionality has been provided by the framework [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) & [jQuery 3.6.1](https://jquery.com/download/).

Great care has been taken, to ensure that the website is designed to meet best practice standards, and is responsive on all screen resolutions.

It has been tested on a variety of devices and screen resolutions: from mobiles; to tablets; and 4k-monitors. It also has proven compatibility with all popular web browsers.

2. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - For their "Markdown Cheat Sheet" and assistive documents on writing a README.md file.

3. [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) - For spell-checking my Text Based Adventure Module during brainstorming.

4. [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) - For providing the mock-up image featured at the top of this document.

5. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For access to their wealth of commercially-available fonts.

6. [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - For providing an emoji based favicon for use in this game.

7. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - For providing software to create the wireframes seen in this README.

8. [GitHub](https://github.com/) - For serving as my IDE of choice and allowing me to create and deploy my repository for user testing and submission purposes.

9. [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11813806/javascript-get-a-functions-variables-value-within-another-function) - For advice on making functions global. Used when deciding if username variables should be made global for later content to access the value.

10. [FreeCodeCamp Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/) - For a convenient primer on the differences between "Var" "Let" and "Const". Used when checking over my variables to ensure correct choices had been made.

11. [Sitepoint Article](https://www.sitepoint.com/delay-sleep-pause-wait/) - Explained the premise of a "sleep" function and the use of promises to stagger my code for the automated computer player box I implemented throughout the project. This allowed for the integration of a more user friendly experience by reducing the number of button presses required to progress for the user. Creating the illusion of a sentient AI presence.

12. [Youtube: developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUEB9FogoP8) - Great tutorial on text animations. Didn't end up implementing as used Animate.css instead but serves as good reference for potential future updates.

13. [CodeBoxx Article](https://code-boxx.com/allow-one-click-javascript/) - For reference when deciding to disable the "maths-box" submit button onClick to prevent multiple answer submissions. Could cause the score to bug out or the player to accidentally fail the game.

19. [Valve: Left4Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8IJepb-hlQ) - Death sounds sampled to make the "destroy" card audio heard at the end of this game.
