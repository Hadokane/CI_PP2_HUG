## Academic Project Aims
---

I am currently pursuing my **Diploma in Web App Development** from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ "code institute").

The academic aim of this project is to demonstrate my newly developed skills within...

I intend to display this throughout the project via my: coding, comments, commits, and the explanation provided by this README file.

Additional functionality has been provided by the framework [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) & [jQuery 3.6.1](https://jquery.com/download/).

Great care has been taken, to ensure that the website is designed to meet best practice standards, and is responsive on all screen resolutions.

It has been tested on a variety of devices and screen resolutions, from mobiles to 4k-monitors, and has proven compatibility with all popular web browsers.
